The Stone Age is the prehistoric period when early humans primarily used stone tools. It is divided into three phases: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), 
Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). During the Paleolithic era, early humans were hunter-gatherers, relying on stone tools for 
hunting and survival. They lived in caves, made fire, and created cave paintings, which give insights into their way of life. The Mesolithic period 
marked a transition, where humans began domesticating animals and developing more refined tools.

The Neolithic period saw the rise of agriculture, permanent settlements, and pottery-making. People started domesticating plants and animals, leading 
to the foundation of early civilizations. Tools became more advanced, and societies began to organize themselves into small communities. This period 
eventually led to the Bronze Age, where metal tools replaced stone, marking a significant step toward modern human development. The Stone Age laid 
the groundwork for technological and societal advancements that shaped human history.
